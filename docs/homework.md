# **Candidate Assignment**

**One-Week Take-Home Project**

**Agentic AI Workflow for Clinical Data Derivation, Verification, and Traceability**

---

## **1. Role Context**

This assignment is part of the interview process for **AI/ML Lead** and **Senior Scientist** roles within Sanofi Digital R&D.

It is designed to evaluate your ability to design and build practical, production-oriented AI systems in a **regulated healthcare environment**, with a focus on **agentic AI systems**.

We are particularly interested in how you approach:

- agentic system architecture
- data transformation and reasoning
- verification and reliability
- human-in-the-loop workflows
- traceability and auditability
- and production readiness

---

## **2. Role Alignment (Important)**

All candidates complete the same assignment. Expectations differ by level:

**Senior Scientist**

We expect:

- strong technical implementation
- clear agent/workflow design
- solid handling of data logic and validation
- ability to build a working prototype

---

**AI/ML Lead**

In addition to the above, we expect:

- deeper system architecture thinking
- clear trade-offs and design decisions
- ability to generalize to platform-level systems
- strong perspective on:

- reliability
- governance
- regulatory constraints
- long-term evolution

---

## **3. Background**

Clinical data workflows require transforming structured datasets into analysis-ready outputs that support reporting, regulatory submission, and decision-making.

These workflows must balance:

- automation
- correctness
- auditability
- and human oversight

In this assignment, you will design and implement a **simplified agentic AI system** that reflects these constraints.

---

## **4. Assignment Objective**

Design and implement a prototype system that:

**Input:**

- a structured dataset (mock clinical data)
- a simplified transformation specification

**Output:**

- derived analysis-ready dataset or outputs
- verification results
- and a traceable audit trail

Your system should demonstrate a **multi-step agentic workflow**, not a single script or simple LLM wrapper.

---

## **5. Core Requirements**

**A. Multi-Agent Workflow Design**

Your system should include clearly defined components (agents or modules), such as:

- **Specification Review**

- interpret transformation rules
- identify ambiguity or missing logic
- **Transformation / Code Generation**

- generate derivation logic or transformations
- **Verification / Validation**

- check correctness and consistency
- **Refinement / Debugging**

- support iterative correction
- **Audit / Summarization**

- provide explanation and traceability

You may implement agents explicitly or as modular components. The architecture should be clear and well justified.

---

**B. Dependency-Aware Derivation**

Your system must handle dependencies between variables:

- distinguish source vs derived variables
- ensure correct execution order
- avoid incorrect transformations

A DAG or equivalent approach is strongly encouraged.

---

**C. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**

Include at least one human review step:

- reviewing or editing generated logic
- approving outputs
- resolving validation issues

You should also demonstrate:

- how feedback is captured
- how it affects subsequent processing

---

**D. Traceability and Auditability**

Your system must allow reconstruction of results.

At minimum, provide:

- source-to-output lineage
- applied transformation logic
- agent/module responsible
- human interventions
- final output state

---

**E. Memory and Reusability**

Design both:

**Short-Term Memory**

- workflow state
- intermediate outputs

**Long-Term Memory**

- reusable logic
- human feedback
- validated patterns

Explain:

- what is stored
- how it is retrieved
- how it improves performance

---

## **6. Suggested Input Scope**

Keep the scope manageable.

Example dataset fields:

- patient_id
- age
- sex
- treatment_start_date
- visit_date
- lab_value
- response

Example derived outputs:

- AGE_GROUP
- TREATMENT_DURATION
- RESPONSE_FLAG
- ANALYSIS_POP_FLAG
- RISK_GROUP

You may define your own dataset and specification.

---

## **7. Technical Expectations**

You may use:

- Python or R
- Streamlit / FastAPI / CLI / notebook
- LLMs, rules, or hybrid approaches

Focus on:

- system design quality
- reasoning
- working prototype

---

## **8. Deliverables**

**3. Design Document (2–4 pages)**

Include:

- traceability
- memory design
- trade-offs
